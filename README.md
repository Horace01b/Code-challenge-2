# Event Guest List Manager

The **Event Guest List Manager** is a dynamic web app that allows users to manage a guest list for an event. Users can add guests, categorize them (Friend, Family, Colleague), track RSVP status, edit guest details, filter by category, and see how many are attending â€” all with data saved in local storage.
